[OCLint](http://oclint.org/) is a fantastic static code analysis tool for improving quality and reducing defects by inspecting C, C++ and Objective-C code.

<!--more-->

I'm not going to copy-paste the rest of [oclint.org](http://oclint.org) here, check it out to see what the tool can do. In this article you will learn how to set it up and use for Mobile CI.

OCLint is often referred as a [lint](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_%28software%29) tool, but in the end of the day it's a static analysis tool, meaning it analyses your code statically, that is without running it.

## Install

For quite a while I though OCLint wasn't available via [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) package manager. While it technically isn't there yet, it's supported by [Homebrew Cask](http://caskroom.io/). If you never used it yet, Homebrew Cask is an extension for Homebrew and lets you to manage OS X applications just like packages. Another benefit of this tool is that it includes other packages like oclint which are not yet available in Homebrew.

{% highlight bash %}
brew install caskroom/cask/brew-cask
{% endhighlight %}

Now install OCLint

{% highlight bash %}
brew cask install oclint
{% endhighlight %}

Check the installation, it's now sitting in `usr/local/`.

## Use

I will write about using OCLint with `xcodebuild`, basically rewording [official documentation](http://docs.oclint.org/en/dev/guide/xcodebuild.html). OCLint supports all other tools, check out [documentation for details](http://docs.oclint.org/en/dev/index.html#usage).

Using OCLint with `xcodebuild` requires 3 steps.

- Build and capture output.
- Generate compile commands database (JSON format) for OCLint using `xcodebuild` output.
- Run OCLint using generated JSON database.

The first step is straightforward, run `xcodebuild` the way you would run it normally, the only difference is that you want to capture build output. Use `tee` command to do that, for example

{% highlight bash %}
xcodebuild clean build -project MyProject -scheme MyScheme -configuration Debug | tee xcodebuild.log
{% endhighlight %}

It is recommended to use _Debug_ configuration for static analysis.

Next, generate compilation commands database with `oclint-xcodebuild` command. This command expects a file named `xcodebuild.log` by default, but in the example I will pass it explicitly. The default output file name is `compile_commands.json` but I'll be more verbose anyway and specify output file name.

{% highlight bash %}
oclint-xcodebuild -output compile_commands.json xcodebuild.log
{% endhighlight %}

Optionally you can use `-e | -exclude` option and pass regular expression which will exclude the files you are not interested in, such as 3rd party source code.

Finally, use `oclint-json-compilation-database` to run oclint and generate report.

{% highlight bash %}
oclint-json-compilation-database \
  ${LINT_EXCLUDES} \
  -- \
  -report-type ${LINT_REPORT_TYPE} \
  ${LINT_RULES} \
  ${LINT_DISABLE_RULES} \
  ${LINT_THRESHOLD} \
  -o ${LINT_REPORTS_DIR}/${LINT_REPORT_FILE} \
  -stats \
  -verbose \
  -list-enabled-rules
{% endhighlight %}  

Let's analyse this call in details and expand actual values of all environment variables.

First you call `oclint-json-compilation-database` and specify it's own arguments. In this case it is a list of excludes passed as `${LINT_EXCLUDES}`. Each folder you want to exclude should be passed with it's own `-e` flag, for example

{% highlight bash %}
LINT_EXCLUDES = -e Libraries -e lib
{% endhighlight %}

The `-i [INCLUDES]` option is used to do the opposite to exclude.

The double dash `--` indicates the start of arguments which will be passed to invocation of `oclint` command.

**Report type** (`LINT_REPORT_TYPE`) specified via `-report-type` can be one of `text`, `html`, `xml`, `json` and `pmd`. For CI tasks you should definitely use [PMD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PMD_%28software%29) report type. While running locally stick with `html`. So you should set `LINT_REPORT_TYPE` to one of these values. Read the [full documentation](http://docs.oclint.org/en/dev/customizing/reports.html) for more.

**Lint rules** (`LINT_RULES`) is an option with which you can override default threshold values for rules. For example, Objective-C is very verbose language, so let's increase thresholds for the the max length of line of code, name of method and name of variable. This is how it will look in shell script

{% highlight bash %}
# Rules
LINT_LONG_LINE=300
LINT_LONG_VARIABLE_NAME=64
LINT_LONG_METHOD=150

LINT_RULES="-rc LONG_LINE=${LINT_LONG_LINE} \
      -rc LONG_VARIABLE_NAME=${LINT_LONG_VARIABLE_NAME} \
      -rc LONG_METHOD=${LINT_LONG_METHOD}"
{% endhighlight %}

You may want to disable some rules as well. This could be useful when working with some legacy code which smells a lot and there are no plans to fix it ever. In cases like this it's easier to silent some warnings. For example, let's disable warning about the use of `_ivarName` outside of accessors and initializers. Let's also ignroe useless parentheses and warnings about unused method parameters.

{% highlight bash %}
# Disable rules
LINT_DISABLE_RULES="-disable-rule=UnusedMethodParameter \
            -disable-rule=UselessParentheses \
            -disable-rule=IvarAssignmentOutsideAccessorsOrInit"
{% endhighlight %}

[Full list of rules](http://docs.oclint.org/en/dev/rules/index.html) for further reference.

**Threshold** allows you to control when analysis passes or fails. There are 3 priorities (Priority 1, 2 and 3) and each comes with default thresholds (0, 10 and 20). You can use `-max-priority-<N>` command line option to customize priority `N` threshold. This is how you would change it to 0, 20 and 30 correspondingly

{% highlight bash %}
# Threshold
LINT_PRIORITY_1_THRESHOLD=0
LINT_PRIORITY_2_THRESHOLD=20
LINT_PRIORITY_3_THRESHOLD=30
LINT_THRESHOLD = "-max-priority-1=${LINT_PRIORITY_1_THRESHOLD} -max-priority-2=${LINT_PRIORITY_2_THRESHOLD} -max-priority-3=${LINT_PRIORITY_3_THRESHOLD}"
{% endhighlight %}

**Output** can be specified via `-o` option. If you are using PMD report type, write out to XML file, for HTML report, write to HTML format. Better create a separate directory for reports, for example

{% highlight bash %}
# Reports
LINT_REPORTS_DIR=oclint-reports
# use .html for HTML report type
LINT_REPORT_FILE=oclint.xml

mkdir -p ${LINT_REPORTS_DIR}
{% endhighlight %}

Finally add some verbosity with `-stats` to output statistics, `-list-enabled-rules` to eyeball the rules being used and `-verbose` for what it stands.

## Summary

Give it a go. You now have a very powerful tool in your tool belt. Figure out your custom project thresholds, integrate it as part of your project [makefile]({% post_url 2015-02-08-mobile-ci---makefiles %}), run it as CI job and output reports using one of the plugins available.
